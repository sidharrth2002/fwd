      "Example 77: Dear Sirs / Madam , I would like to first of all thank Ms Yvonne from Customer Service that called me today to follow up on my enquiry on 10th Aug 2022 . She managed to put my purchase on the NDP57 ( Less 57 % Promotion Plan ) . I was travelling and returned on 10th Aug and when I saw my email on your NDP - 57 % promotion plan , I immediately obtained a quote for the Classic plan and included a rider to cover any driver . I was quite happy to enjoy the 57 % discount but unfortunately when I proceeded with the payment and already submitted my credit card details for the check out then I realised that the quoted amount have changed as the time was just minutes past 12 midnight of 10th Aug 2022 . Immediately I put a stop to the transaction and contacted the online chat but could not get a satisfactory reply , so I left a message for your return call . My point is that your system could have advised your customers 5 minutes before the cut - off rather than let the transaction take place and change the price . Or you should have honoured the quoted price since the transaction has already reached the final step of purchase ! Instead your system chose to sneakily change the total amount just seconds before they hit the PAY button ! I understand that your system need a rule for the cut - off mark but I must say that it was disappointing as you did not consider that the customer had already taken the implied step of payment . I would suggest that for your future promotions , if the transaction have already reached the final step of payment ( credit card details already provided ) your system should accept it rather than losing the sale ! Your system could also prompt the customer to pay immediately in order to enjoy the discount provided the transaction is at the final check - out step . Thank you for your time to hear me out on this . Best regards .\n",

She explained to me in detail on the process , the steps I should take and how I can save some money on cancellation fee . She went further and email me on what ’ s being spoken about earlier on phone . I ’ m so appreciative of her service . She ’ s fantastic . It is so rare to have such a high level of customer service these days and this particular experience is really worth sharing . Thank you Tracy . In the subsequent weeks after I sold my motorcycle and purchased the another , this case was well followed up by Nora , also from customer engagement team , via phone calls and emails . Nora provided timely and useful updates on my request . It was overall a very positive experience for me .

Dare not answer my factual ( not opinion - based ) questions why they are incompetent , making mistake after mistake and worse still trying to conceal and not discuss same mistakes . XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXUpdate below to include reply from FWD . Jeferson Maleza : I will make my replies public so that potential customers can see what a bunch of liars you are . At 1746hrs on 15 Mar 2022 I got a call ( ONE CALL ) from 31656294 . It rang for fewer than 10 times . I missed the call . Then I get an SMS which says : Hello ! Our attempts to contact you were unsuccessful . Do call us at 6820 8888 during our operating hours . Thank you ! – FWD TeamSo already , even down at this level your company cannot stop lying . You company calls me once but sends a follow up SMS which claims that many calls were made . Then your Donna Ang e - mails me at 1845hrs 15 Mar 2022 . She asks for a time that they could call me . From previous experience at 1515hrs 02 Mar 2022 during your Christina ' s call to me , I raised about 10 issues which were admitted to . However , in a subsequent follow up e - mail by Irish to me on 10 Mar 2022 ( EIGHT DAYS LATER ) , the points admitted to dropped to just TWO . Is this honest behaviour , when all you need to do is play back the recording of the call and check what was raised ( in case Irish somehow has very bad memory ) ? So tell me why I should even bother to talk to you people when the issues I bring up conveniently get forgotten / discounted / trivialised ? Are you afraid of addressing your fraudulent behaviour and service lapses in writing and thus prefer to talk on the phone where you hope there is no permanent record ? Furthermore , when I raised the \" missing \" issues in an e - mail dated 11 Mar 2022 , there has since been no reply . Why not ? Very busy ah ? Or dare not answer ? Stop your cowardly behaviour and man up .\n",

      "Example 854: Stupid website . Buggy process . Tried to buy travel insurance using retrieve personal details function ( for existing customer ) when completing the form . Process kept hanging . Unable to pay . Instructed to call 68208888 . Pointless - office not yet open . Fast With Deductions . That ' s what FWD Insurance stands for . If you are doing your research about FWD and starting off with reading unhappy reviews - you are a wise consumer indeed . They have many 5 Star reviews - because the buying process was smooth , fast , efficient etc . But it ' s all meaningless . Why ? Because any fool can devise a process that is good at taking your money . Isn ' t that how scammers work ? How does FWD taking your money painlessly make it worthy of a 5 Star rating ? Surely the BUYING of the insurance is not as important as HOW WELL the product protects you , and HOW SMOOTHLY you are able to make claims against the policy . The real worth of a company is how it deals with problems - for example , PROBLEMS THE COMPANY ITSELF CAUSED , including PROBLEMS IT DOES NOT WANT TO ADMIT . If your trip has not even started and the company cannot even issue the policy documents properly - does that not make you think how it will ever look after you , when it can ' t even get it ' s own administrative processes in order ? When you buy insurance , what is the one thing you want ? A receipt ? Ice cream ? Nasi lemak ? Or a policy document ? Later on , they try to trivialise this event . What If they did the same to a disaster that happened to you ? Insurance is a product that looks after the \" What - If ? \" moments . But FWD Insurance themselves do not look into their own What - If events either out of sheer incompetence or just bloody laziness . I tried to buy travel insurance at 0830hrs on a normal Wednesday morning . The process failed . The failed process gave a number to call . But nobody answered . It was connected to a stupidly designed IVR system that eventually cut me off . I could not leave a message . So it was one failure after another after another . Did no one think , WHAT IF a customer tries unsuccessfully to buy a policy outside of normal office hours ? Why provide a number to call that is manned only during office hours ? Does it take a genius to ask WHAT IF that happens ? I wasn ' t even buying a policy at 4 in the morning - it was 8 . 30 . Is morale in the office so low that the staff just don ' t give a s * * t ? In their response to my feedback , they try to gloss over the \" Broken Link \" event as being now resolved . Yes it is resolved , but along the way EVEN MORE mistakes were made in the wake of the problem - which they conveniently left out . I ' m quite sure that they do not have a ready list of those customers affected by the Broken Link incident . Why would that matter ? Because if the same customer comes back again to buy another policy , he will surely NOT forget how he felt scammed the first time around he bought a policy but was given a link that did not work , if and when he again meets problems trying to buy another policy . So it would help if their system could automatically flag such aggrieved customers , and ensure that NO MORE PROBLEMS OCCUR . But of course , they did not think of this . No one at FWD Insurance cares . Devising a solution to such a What If scenario is just too much work for a company that just wants to suck your money . Update after their reply to me more than a week after my initial review - this is my reply : Irish , You still do not understand how unsatisfactory your company ' s service is . Your e - mail reply is proof . You gloss over the problems I experienced as a mere \" Broken Link \" issue . It is much more more than that . Check the e - mails from your Donna Ang timestamped 1034hrs 12 Oct 2021 . She claims to have attached a pdf copy of the policy when she did not such thing . I send her a reply at 1110hrs 12 Oct 2021 pointing out this fact . She replies at 1236hrs 12 Oct 2021 and admits her mistake . Your company has a serious problem with not being able to look after details . ONLY when you admit this problem will you be on your way to fixing it . Your email is proof that FWD insurance STILL refuses to admit that they cannot look after details .\n",

I had submitted an accident claim of S $ 203 . 40 for the outpatient treatment to FWD insurance but was rejected . Below was the reply from FWD insurance . 1 . The incident was not considered an \" accident \" as it seems like a prolonged strain on your back during house cleaning and the pain felt later and was not immediate . ; 2 . An accident is where a sudden and one time incident that causes the pain or injury almost immediately ; and 3 .

Took international health for both my partner and I , as we are expats without inpatient insurance . Both of us have outpatient provided by employer . Both of us consulted GP then specialists for medical conditions . When it was time to do procedures at the clinic , we were confident it ' ll go smooth because we took FWD with all the available top ups to even avoid any co - payment . But here you have to ask FWD for pre - authorisation . Which takes 10 business days . So you might have to reschedule your procedure . This document must be filled by the surgeon , which is impossible to contact at the hospital . However the hospital can fill the form for you in exchange of few hundred dollars , not covered by FWD . Then the pre - authorisations are denied for both of us . FWD decided that because we had met the GP through another insurer before asking FWD , our conditions were \" pre - existing \" and not covered by the policy . How can a condition can be pre - existing when you ' re asking to do screening tests ? and haven ' t passed the test yet ? You can argue for as long a you want on the phone they don ' t care much . So after money wasted to fill stupid papers , and 2 procedures cancelled , it is now a struggle to cancel this useless insurance , have been sending letters and emails for a months and counting .\n",

They gave me a screen shot of another insurer who applied the same terms but failed to include another competitor who were much more understanding and consistent in their approach . . . I an a nutshell , don ' t believe the slick easy to sign - up process - once they have your money there is no way to look online and check the status of your claim , I had to follow up countless times despite reassurances that I would \" hear back within a week \" Companies ( and there are a number of airlines who fall in the same camp ) may survive the current turmoil but the way they ' ve treated customers versus others in the same industry will be very evident to see when the dust settles on Covid - 19 .\n",

The prompt says , ' date of incident must occur during the trip ' . As a result of this repeated prompt , I was unable to submit the form and had to turn to ' calling me back ' function or sending my requests to generic emails which means little chance of getting back to customers . I hope they improve their online claim form format to allow for greater room of flexibility . Furthermore , even though Co - vid 19 was made a known event on 31 January , I ’ ve purchased this policy at least a month before the unforeseen events of 1 . WHO ’ s declaration of Covid - 19 as a global pandemic and 2 . Singapore government ’ s advisory against ALL travels . In verbatim , the FWD travel policy has explicitly mentioned that FWD will not pay for ' any claims for Trip cancellation and loss of deposit benefit and Trip postponement benefit if you buy your policy less than 3 days before your scheduled departure date . ’ However , I have purchased this policy at least two months before my scheduled departure date and in light of these unforeseen events . Besides , a clause in the policy document includes ' trip cancellation due to serious public events ' , of these unforeseen events include travel advisory by singapore government and / or WHO declaration of pandemic that occurs 30 days before the scheduled departure date . I am thus writing to request for a claim only for my flights since this policy promises to cover these unforeseeable events upon my policy purchase . I had to turn to this platform to leave a review ( my first time leaving a review on a public platform ) as my emails were not replied after several days , and the customer service staff on the phone was relentless in parroting Co - vid 19 as a known event without engaging my justification . I hope this review will bring to light some of the difficulties of making a claim from FWD travel insurance .\n",

Subsequently they reviewed my claim and accepted it . While I was disappointed by their initial non - response , I applaud their follow up and goodwill gesture . Thus raised the rating from 1 to 4 stars . Initial Review : I had bought a travel insurance with FWD for my Bangladesh trip from Singapore in Feb . While I was in Bangladesh , my travel agent informed me my return connecting flight from Bangkok to Singapore was cancelled and they could only offer me another flight in the next morning ( more than 12 hours later than my scheduled flight ) . I had no choice as I already paid in full for the ticket . I submitted a claim for flight delay with the necessary supporting documents to FWD after returning home . After 2 email correspondence , FWD replied that as I was notified by the agent more than 24 hours before departure , I was not qualified for the claim . I read again the policy and no where did I find any clause about the 24 hour window . I sent them another email asking for clarification but no response for almost 2 weeks . I was left with a very bad impression that FWD charges a very low premium to lure customers but will find all the excuses to reject a claim without valid explanation . I am happy if someone in the insurance industry can enlighten me about this clause or is it just another stupid excuse as FWD is not taking my query seriously\n",

I cannot leave my family or think about travelling during this period yet the agent who spoke with me didn ' t even seem to try finding a solution for me . I even had to share the nature of death in hopes that she would understand or take it more seriously . I was just given a single sentence response - \" I ' m sorry but our policy only covers 30 days from event and since your trip is in April we can ' t do anything . \" She did not sound unpleasant but she did sound inexperienced and put me on hold to check ( with whom , I don ' t know ) I ' m not sure what she claims as event , the death of my sister or my trip . I ' m really disappointed in FWD . I wrote in with confidence that you would be able to assist me . A friend encouraged me to do so as his was a success story . His insurance provider did help with claims when he lost a loved one . Obviously , not FWD . This is my 2nd time purchasing your travel insurance and thought you would show more heart in handling my case . I am struggling to get in touch with the airlines due to the virus situation and it ' s upsetting that I ' m put on the back burner due to travelers cancelling trips everywhere . I ' m here trying to get help for something completely different . Please understand that not everyone deals with grief in 30 days and you don ' t expect everyone to shake it off and travel within 30 days . Death is unexpected and nobody is prepared for it . I have a family to look after and other commitments that came with my sister ' s passing . I don ' t wish to name your agent . I ' m just writing this with a very heavy heart . It would help if you could share where your policy states that I am unable to claim in my current situation as I cannot find it on your website . Thank you .\n",

      "Example 4409: Travel Insurance ( Claims ) - The product itself is just mehhh because the way 30 days from return of the trip was counted very different from what I understood and how some of the other insurers would have explained . I took a night flight back and touched down on 16 / 10 / 2019 , 11 : 05pm but FWD treated it as that I was already back in SG for an entire day of 16th . Perhaps , I misunderstood how days should be counted . Despite the above , the claims handler ( Joyee ) for my Parent travel claim is really good with what she does . Prompt replies , Explanations given and she also advices well on the next step / requirements . When she explained on why one of the claim would not be payable , she went the extra mile to check with the management , but the management still rejected it . Term Life Insurance - Benjamin ( I dont know which dept but he is the dude that replies on the webchat ) & Tracy from the Customer Engagement Team is very helpful . After the purchase of the Term Life Insurance for my parent previously , FWD system did not send out the ' welcome E - mail ' . The both of them assisted me from the start to the end of the whole process . Which includes all the ' silly ' questions that I had to ask to re - verify after reading the wordings . So , after all the MILLIONS of questions i have asked , I finally bought it . In conclusion , the reliability of the product , i am not very sure . The only thing that I am sure of is the customer service which is really AWESOME ! The one missing star is for the rejected claim which I still really REALLY disagree on and the 4 stars is for the assistance that Joyee , Benjamin and Tracy have helped out with .

      "Example 5050: In terms of products , FWD is good . However , once the sale is made , the customer engagement team will ruin all the possible good connections you may have had with the brand . It is my regret to have recommended FWD to my family . My sister - in - law started this horrendous journey with an insincere operator who apparently just wanted her to repeat herself without being heard . Subsequently , there were also no follow - up done as promised on their end . Later , she and her husband had to put in hours and hours , days and months following up on their own efforts just to make sure things were right . If the note was to call after 5 . 30pm , FWD will call prior without respecting your note , nor your time . Eventually after months of torment when the head of customer service can finally be reached , this supposed leader of the department showed no remorse in their lack of professionalism and competence . Not all , but most of the encountered staff under customer service were extremely presumptuous and insincere . The follow ups made were not to serve the customers but for them to defend their mistakes and argue their points without listening to the customer . I was beside my sister - in - law when the head of customer service called . I couldn ’ t believe what I heard : the head of customer service offered solutions that she was not going to deliver nor honour . She also ridiculously suggested in the conversation that my sister - in - law and her husband had credit issues when the problem in case was completely non - credit related . It was the most absurd thing I have ever heard the head of anything said , having it being completely irrelevant and inaccurate . Perhaps the head of customer service was experiencing some credit issues herself , but we would like to have someone who can separate their personal issues and deal with the problem objectively . It makes us wonder what is this department for . We really regret using FWD after all these experiences with the ludicrous customer engagement team . Such shameful behaviours of theirs were the least and last we had expected . Be warned . Response to reply : Lina Zulkifli as the head of the department to be of as said above is definitely unprofessional , let alone proper of the job title . Thanks for your reply to ascertain our points . This is evidently nothing assuring .\n",

She completely blew me away with her patience during the marathon call , her consistent cheerfulness from start to finish , which make you feel that the company appreciates you as a customer and her genuinely helpful attitude in making sure that you truly get the help you needed . Top class after - sales service by Ms Koki and her team . I moved here from Aunty Lucy . I feel it pointless to even want to make detail comparison .

FWD is brilliant in this way . 3 .

Therefore , I had initially rated 1 star here as it seems unfounded for a valid claim to take that long ; I thought I was being scammed by an online insurance company . To be fair in reviewing , I ' ve edited this review to update that I have finally received a call yesterday from FWD settling it and explaining that they had a high volume of claim due to the travel season , hence the time gap in response . The CS contact on the line was very sincere and apologetic ; they reviewed the case and we settled it all within the day . I feel that I should give them the benefit of doubt and update this review to reflect the situation . I have given four stars because I feel resolved issues are efforts made to improve things and FWD has really fast service recovery once the issue that had fallen through the cracks is resurfaced up .

      "Example 19130: Most of the reviews here seems to be about purchase . Yes , when it comes to purchasing the package , they are quick and fast to get their money from you . But if you are buying insurance for the assurance that you can get your claims covered promptly , reliability - FWD sucks big time for claims ! . I submitted two separate travel claims - one online and one to their email claims acc a week apart and they can mixed them up into one claim . Furthermore , it took them 2 weeks to reply back to me ( their simple 2 days turnaround is no where visible ) . They outsource their claims to 3rd party making it even more complex . Manager promise to follow up n call me me within a week at a fixed time but did not call back - totally unreliable . The FWD claims n their outsource parties keep pushing things between them . there is no one single source of contact to speak to . i hv to do the chasing myself . Keep asking for additional documents - some documents were already furnished in the initial submission ( they somehow “ lost ” them ? ! - messy ! ) I should hv stayed with my Aviva . plse avoid them — their prizes and marketing gimmicks to lure customers to sign up with them are masking their aweful unreliable claims processing !\n",
